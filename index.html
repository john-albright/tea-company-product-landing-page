      <h1>Company</h1>
      <h3>Quality</h3>
      <p>
        We at TheaThyme pride ourselves in high-quality teas. We take the time required to properly grow,shade, harvest, heat, and process tea leaves to create the finest teas. We offer classic Japanese teas that are sourced ethically with the farmers' well-being in mind. We strive to allow our farmers the independence to grow their tea farms with new materials, technology, and techniques.
      </p>
      <h3>Origin</h3>
      <p>
        All of our teas are sourced from regions in the southwest of Japan, primarily Shizuoka and Kagoshima. Some other teas are grown in Mie, Kyoto, and Fukuoka. Fukuoka is our hot spot for gyokuro, a tea that requires long and precise shading to retain sweetness and increase the caffeine content. Read more about Japanese Tea Growing Regions from the <a href="https://gjtea.org/info/japanese-tea-information/japanese-tea-growing-regions/">Global Japanese Tea Association</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>Awareness & Education</h3>
      <p>
        TheaThyme strives to share Japanese culture with the rest of the world through a product that has become integrated into and associated with Japanese culture. Through our efforts, we hope that others can learn about the complexity of Japanese tea and its place in Japan and its extension into other parts of the world.
