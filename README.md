#[Tea Company Product Landing Page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/build-a-product-landing-page-project/build-a-product-landing-page)

This project is the fourth of five projects completed for freeCodeCamp's first JavaScript certificate: [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/). The Product Landing Page's [assignment instructions](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/build-a-product-landing-page-project/build-a-product-landing-page) were provided by freeCodeCamp. A live demo of the project can be found on [Github](https://john-albright.github.io/tea-company-product-landing-page). 

This application was built with pure CSS and HTML. Many websites were used as inspiration for this product landing page. General information was taken from [Global Japanese Tea Association](https://gjtea.org/info/japanese-tea-information/japanese-tea-growing-regions/). Many images and general information about each tea was sourced from [Kyoto Obobu Tea Farms](https://obubutea.com/) & [Nioteas](https://nioteas.com).
